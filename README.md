# :house: AirBNB Clone Project

This project by <a href="https://www.alxafrica.com" target="_blank">ALX Africa</a> for its Backend Web Pro-Development is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust ```booking platform``` like Airbnb.<br />
It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on:<br />
* Backend Systems.
* Database Design.
* API Development, and
* Application Security.
<br />
The aim is to understand complex architectures, workflows and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

## :mortar_board: Learning Objective

This project is tailored to enhance expertise in modern software development practices. By completing it, I will:

```
->	Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub.
->	Deepen my understanding of backend architecture and database design principles.
->	Implement advanced security measures for API development.
->	Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.
->	Strengthen my ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively.
->	Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem.
```

## :scroll: Requirements

To successfully complete the project tasks, one must:

```
->	Have a GitHub account to create and manage repositories.
->	Be familiar with Markdown syntax for README.md file creation.
->	Possess prior experience with backend frameworks like Django and database systems such as MySQL.
->	Understand software development lifecycle practices, including security, CI/CD, and database design.
->	Be comfortable with modern tools such as Docker, GitHub Actions, or similar CI/CD platforms.
```
## :busts_in_silhouette: Team Roles

* <b>Backend Developer</b>: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
* <b>Database Administrator</b>: Manages Database design, indexing, and optimizations.
* <b>DevOps Engineer</b>: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of backend services.
* <b>QA Engineer</b>: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

## :wrench: Technology Stack

* <b>Django</b>: A high-level Python Web framework used for building the RESTful API.
* <b>Django REST Framework</b>: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful API.
* <b>PostgreSQL</b>: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
* <b>GraphQL</b>: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
* <b>Celery</b>: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
* <b>Redis</b>: Used for caching and session managemnt.
* <b>Docker</b>: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
* <b>CI/CD Pipelines</b>: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## :factory: Database Design

Few of the important fields each key entities require:

* <b>User</b>: First and last name as well as an email.
* <b>Properties</b>: A unique name, location and number of rooms.
* <b>Bookings</b>: A unique identifier, creation date and payment status.
* <b>Reviews</b>: Owner, description as well as reviewed property.
* <b>Payments</b>: Receipt, amount and status.

## :page_with_curl: Feature Breakdown

* <b>User Management</b>: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
* <b>Property Management</b>: Develop features for property listing creation, updates and retrieval.
* <b>Booking System</b>: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
* <b>Payment Processing</b>: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
* <b>Review System</b>: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
* <b>Data Optimization</b>: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## :vertical_traffic_light: API Security

* <b>Authentication</b>: Implement logic establishing users legitimacy during log ins.
* <b>Authorization</b>: Ensure users only have access to API endpoints not requiring admin priviledges and other permissions.
* <b>Rate Limiting</b>: Prevent excessive requests increasing risk of a breakdown. Whether from a malicious actor or a high number of well-intended users.
* <b>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</b>: Mitigate the risk of Cross-Site Request Forgery by only allowing defined origins to make specific HTTP requests, each containing a set of custom headers.

## :recycle: CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery Pipelines are a set of automated processes meant to safely but quickly move from 'generating code' to deploying it as Software solution. They shorten software development and enable early discovery of buggy code before deployment to other environments such as production.<br />
Whenever new lines of code are added, they get thoroughly tested before integration in the codebase and deployment. This guarantee quality.
